# Server Configuration
# Railway will auto-assign PORT, but we specify 3002 for local development
PORT=3002

# Google Gemini API Key (for document classification)
# Get your API key from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
# or use the same key from parent .env
VITE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Deployment Notes:
# - For Railway deployment, see RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md
# - Railway automatically sets PORT, so this PORT value is overridden in production
# - Make sure to add GEMINI_API_KEY to Railway environment variables
